Hi, I'm Johan ðŸ‘‹
I've been honing my technical skills since the early '90s, starting with web development in the early days of the internet.
Exploring the possibilities with early LAMP-stacks and later cloud computing. UNIX lover and a kuberenetes advocate.

Nowadays, my focus is almost completely on AI/ML, where I'm dedicating my time and energy to exploring new possibilities of generative AI.

I'm excited about the future of technology and thrilled to be part of its evolution!
